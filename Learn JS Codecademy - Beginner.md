## Introduction

7 Fundamental data types in JS:
- Strings
- Numbers
- Booleans (true/false)
- Undefined
- Symbol
- Object

Built-in arithmetic operators:
- + (add)
- - (subtract)
- * (multiply)
- / (divide)
- % (remainder)

Objects can have properties, methods and store information. Properties are denoted by appending the object or instance with a full-stop + property name e.g.
```JS 
// prints length of string
console.log('hello'.length);
```

Methods can perform actions. Methods are called by appending the object or instance with a full-stop + method name + brackets e.g.
```JS
//prints string in uppercase
console.log('hello'.toUpperCase());
```
